### **RequestAnimationFrame**

The `window.requestAnimationFrame()` method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser call a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. The method takes a callback as an argument to be invoked before the repaint. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame">Read more about this here.</a>

### **Object-Oriented JavaScript**
Make sure you are comfortable with Object-Oriented JavaScript:

- What is an object?
- How is an object different from a primitive in JavaScript (e.g., can a primitive have methods?)
- What are some ways to create or instantiate a new object?
- How do you modify properties, or add/remove properties from an object?
- What is a constructor function (or class)?
- What is `this`? What does it refer to and how is it used in different contexts (i.e., in a constructor function, a method, etc.)?
- How do you add a property or method to a constructor's prototype?
- What is prototypal inheritance and how is it implemented?
